                <h3>My experience traveling</h3>
                <img src="assets/img/blog/experience.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="landscape">
                <p>I am traveling this big beautiful but also mean world and I'm really liking it, most of the time. I'm traveling alone and no I didn't really choose to travel alone, just got sick of waiting until someone finally wanted to come with me.
                    Or all those people who say they want to go with you but never will.<br>Apparently, if you travel alone and you're single I've notes you have a lot of boyfriend's or everyone will expect that you will find that guy while you're traveling,
                    hasn't happened yet.<br>Ow yes, a lot of guys would wane have sex with you and occasionally they wane pay for it, yes it has happened.</p>
                <p>I like that I get to meet so many new people that are kind of all like me, okay just a little bit. I have to say most are very nice and friendly and others rob or ripe you off, yes this also happened. I still hope some of them will stick,
                    I would love to get some friends in different places.<br>It is a big learning curve and a lot of challenges. Like packing my bag every time, getting it to fit every time and not over 20 kilos. I can pack it now fully in 30 minutes.
                    It is also good for exercise walking around with 26 kilo extra gets you into shape, I am much stronger now and most of the time the only one how can carry my bag.<br>Or figuring out how to get to the next hostel and finding one without
                    spending a fortune, yes I am on a budget. I hate it when people just keep saying but what does it matter it is way cheaper here anyway, well the more I can save the farther I can go and no I'm not trying to do it on an amazing tide
                    budget that will never work. Some people can do it or they don't mind sleeping in the park, street, beach or with someone just so that they don't spend too much money. Yah no that is not for me.
                    <br>Ow, my social skills have improved so much, now I can just approach people I have never met and start talking to them! I used to be shy and let me people mostly walk all over me, that's how they say it. Now it doesn't even matter
                    how I am talking to, I mostly forget to ask their names.</p>
                <p>I do sometimes hate it, okay maybe that's a little harsh but yes I get fat up with it. I don't want to say goodbye or hopefully see you later to some all the people. I sometimes wish I wasn't traveling with bags that I have to keep packing
                    and unpacking, it's cheaper also doing it with a small bag. Sometimes I get lonely in between all those dunking people how don't care how much they spend while on holiday. Most times everything is totally not how you want it or it
                    all goes totally wrong and you have to spend way more money then you want, yes that also happened.
                    <br>Ow and the crying. I'm not really the crying type, you can ask my family but I've cried way more on my second trip then I did in my entire life before it.</p>
                <p>I have experienced that traveling has its ups and downs but I think that the way you handed with it will tell you what kind of a traveler you are and in the end what kind of a person you have become because of it.</p>

    <section class="container" id="what-could-happen">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <h3>Do you know what could happen?</h3>
                <img src="assets/img/blog/could-happen.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Landscape">
                <h4>Do you know what could happen?</h4>
                <p>Is the one question I got the most when I told people about my plan to travel by myself. Most of them where all the same negative scenario's of what could happen to me. If I am honest I cannot remember if any of them even was positive.
                    Okay my family where lightly enthusiastic about it but they know I could do it. I have been independent for a while by the time I decided to do this at the age of 26. Yes it took me a while and now I have a bachelor I can't do anything
                    with anymore but I would not wane change it in the world.</p>
                <h5>I can remember the most negative scenario's people can up with:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>You could get rubbed</li>
                    <li>You could die from a disease, it has happened to people they knew</li>
                    <li>I can get killed, like you always see on tv</li>
                    <li>I can get rapped</li>
                    <li>You could get drugged</li>
                    <li>I don't speak the language how can you even communicate</li>
                    <li>I don't know what kind of people are out there</li>
                    <li>You could get scammed</li>
                    <li>You could get sick from the food don't eat anything raw or washed with tape water</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Getting the point by now I think and yes this could all happen to you. I have to say some of it has happend to me. What kind of life would you have, if you had to make sure that this would never happen to you. To tell you the truth it
                    could happen to you. But you wouldn't have to travel that far as some people might think for it to happen.
                </p>
                <h5>So I would say why stay home?</h5>
                <p>I live in the Netherlands and it is perceived as a "save country". though in the Netherlands people get rubbed, rapped, drugged or scammed too. I don't know in what country you live in. But are you sure this could not happen in your country?
                    Take America, ow my what a dangerous country is that, with the shootings, drugs and gangs. Even a very "save" country as Sweden. Has places you should not go I have heard. So what if it could happen any where in this big beautiful
                    world, why stay home. I have wrote about. If you want to know more about traveling alone.</p>
                <h5>But do they ever tell any of the positive things that could happen to you?</h5>
                <p>I have learned so much about myself and overcome so much of my fears and struggles. Some I still have but not as strong anymore. I can tell you for sure that how I felt as a young woman. That I don't feel like that any more about myself.
                    I can remember that after a daytrip in Vietnam. We went out for dinner with most of the people who attended the daytrip. I told them that I was very shy growing up. One of the woman there told me she would have never thought that.</p>
                <p>Traveling alone will make you feel better by yourself, will help you to develop your social skills, will help you learn to think different about things and the people that live in other countries. Or at least that is what it has done for
                    me. If you think that I never have a bad day or that I never cry about anything, you're so wrong. I can tell you I have never cried so much as when I went traveling the second time. But after crying and getting over that feeling I
                    could think better about how to fix what I was crying about or think of another way to go about it, so I found it useful.</p>

                <h3>Me beautiful?</h3>
                <img src="assets/img/blog/me.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Me">
                <h5>Today</h5>
                <p>Me beautiful? To be honest I still would not discribe myself as beautiful. There are times that I don't feel much better about my self then when I started this journey.</p>
                <p>When I don't have plans or I don't have to get out the house. I feel like a boring woman that only eats and watches tv or movies on her laptop. So yes I still have things to work at. I think we all have to keep working on our self te feel
                    better abour our selfs. More because of the fact that we all change. There is a time that we are single, we are a partner, maybe single again, a wife or husband, we become a parent or we decide to become the person we Always felt we
                    where.
                </p>
                <h5>Beautiful</h5>
                <p>People have been telling me the older I got how beautiful I look. On my trip I have been hearing this even more from different people. From both man and woman. I still can not get used to this. I don't see my self as beautiful. In a hostel
                    in Sydney I was talking with this guy. I told him that a lot of guys would like to have sex with me. He told me that I had to see it as complement, that it means that I look beautiful.</p>
                <p>I think that it might be a complement but I do not base the way how I feel about my self on it. Sorry guys. It sounds like a silly fact. Like how many man would like to have sex with me. To tell the truth I don't know where to base or
                    what "facts" I need to base that on. It is also different for everyone. I think you have to learn how you feel about your self.</p>
                <h5>The old me</h5>
                <p>I started this trip not feeling very good about my self. People told me I was beautiful and still every time I liked a guy he didn't like me. So what does the fact that your are beautiful have to
                    <br />do with anything. If you can't even get the guy you like to go on a date with you. Also I was a little bit to heavy. Even thow I told my self that having a couple of kilo's more is no problem. I know just "losing" weight doesn't
                    fix very thing.
                </p>
                <p>I had no friends. I thought I had but I found out they where school or work friends. I am also not very good in keeping intouch with everyone. So that does not make it easier to keep friends. it did not change that i felt shit when I was
                    home with myself.</p>
                <h5>Changing</h5>
                <p>I learned so much on this journey and it hasn't even ended. I know now I like to explore, traveling in a way that others wouldn't. Like cycling  32 km, to see a waterfall . While everyone takes the car because there are to many hills.
                    Or I walk for a couple of km to get to my hostel instead of taking a car or public transport. Don't get me wrong I also do that. You can see so much more when you take a different way than when you are just being driven around.</p>
                <p>I actually like going to places I don't know anyone, it feel good. This means that I talk a lot with people, yet I still don't really like calling people on the phone. A lot of my new friends and people that I meet don't believe that I
                    am a shy person. I talk to much now, I think. Or the fact that I keep going to new places alone makes them think I am a very out going person.</p>
                <h5>Feeling better</h5>
                <p>In the beginning I didn't really know why I went on this journey. I just know that I wanted to get away from the situation I was in. I do still remember the place I was when I realized that I LOVED what I was doing. This was the first
                    time in my live I felt this way. It was in Ho Chi Minh and I was wondering the streets. This doesn't mean that I will never go home again, don't worry family. I also lost weight I don't know how much. The important thing is that I
                    feel a lot better about my body now. I'm more afraid now to become like those too skinny women.</p>
                <p>Back to feeling better about my self. All the people I met and experiences that I had. Made me believe in myself. Also I have learned that I can do more then that I every thought. I can tell you that feels good. I can't say that I feel
                    different now that I have lost the weight. I just know that I carry my self different. If you ask my sister I still dress horrible. Even the fact that no guy, so far in real live, has asked me out or taken an interest in me doesn't
                    bother me that much any more. The fact that I feel good about myself. And that I have been starting to love the person that I am now is more important then any guy ever could be. The fact that a lot of people think that I look beautiful,
                    now is more believable.</p>

                <h3>The Hand luggage challenge</h3>
                <img src="assets/img/blog/luggage-challenge.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Beach houses">
                <h5>The hand Luggage challenge</h5>
                <p>Okay everyone knows those advertising from the budget airlines and you think that is a good deal. When you think I'll book that you find out you have to pay for Luggage. Sometimes that is even more expensive than the ticket itself. Well,
                    I have met some people that just travel with hand luggage and nothing more. I have always wondered if I could do that for a longer period. Okay, I have done it for shorter trips with the knowledge what kind of weather it was. But not
                    for a longer, more than 2 weeks and not knowing the weather.</p>
                <p>So when I booked my flight to Australia I decided to give my self a challenge. To do this trip with only a bag that counts as hand Luggage. Here in Europe you´re bag can be up to 10kg so I thought that would be easy. Then I found out that
                    in Australia you only get 7kg for your hand Luggage. I was still sure that it wasn't that difficult either.
                </p>
                <p>I have traveled a couple of times for a longer period. So I knew that in the end, you don´t wear most of what you bring. Or maybe that is just me. So knowing that I thought it would easy to do this. I made the decision a long time ago
                    to not buy any souvenirs for my family. Instead of that to send them a postcard. That they can also put on the fridge. It does not cost me much or at least not all the time. So if they don´t like it anymore they can put it in a box
                    or get rid of it. I still hope that they will keep it.</p>
                <h5>Shopping</h5>
                <p>So most of the time I do not go shopping. I think ahead for the possibility that I might want to go shopping. Now I get that that might sound weird. What I mean with that is when packing my bag I take some pieces I like. But most of my
                    pieces are clothes that Idon't like that much or I don't wear that much.</p>
                <p>Why I do this? Because when you travel with a bag/suitcase you have a limited of space. Or in this case weight so if you want something new, you have to get rid of something else. I don't throw it away I donate it to charity or a homeless
                    shelter. They can always use clothes and most clothes you own look way to good to just throw out.
                </p>
                <h5>The weight</h5>
                <p>I don't own a working scale. I am pretty sure that it just needs a new battery and then it will work again. So I had no idea how heavy my bag was when I checked in at the airport. Also, you don't need to bring a stack of papers of your
                    flight when checking in. Okay with some budget airlines they ask you to do it. If you don't they will charge for printing one out for you. That isn't always cheap so in those cases just print out your boarding card but more you don't
                    need. So I found out it was over 8kg but that could be fine. That was not really the case with my first flight. I had 1,5 kg too much. To be fare I had food and 2 bottles with me and I already put most of my clothes on. I got told
                    that is what you do when you're bag is a bit too heavy. And I couldnt put more çlothes on. But I did not want to throw out any of my things. Luckily I found a young man how helped me out by saying we were traveling together. So you
                    can have 14 kg together and it worked.</p>
                <p>After that, I took a good look at the clothes that I took. That day I donated half of all my shirts and tops. I bought one shirt because I really liked it and it was just 1 Australian dollar. And the book I brought I left at the hostel.
                    For someone else to read when I finished it. So I felt a lot better than next time it would be closer to the 7kg. Again I filled up my water bottles and put them in another bag.  Hoping it would weigh even less and what do you think.
                    They did not weigh any bags so I stressed out for nothing. And yes I put some of my clothes on. This time because I was less cold last time on the airplane. Youknow you don´t get a blanket with the budget airlines.</p>
                <p>So before my last flight, I bought new shoes because the one I have are busted. I could not totally walk my new shoes  in. So I had to put them in my bag, so more weight. I was a bit worried again if I could go on the flight without paying
                    extra. I found that it is not cheap, they charge you amouth no matter how much you are over. So this time I thought I will just check in at the airport. The lady at check in missed to see my little bag and my big bag was just a bit
                    too heavy but she gave me the all clear. After I went to put most of my clothes on and put everything in one bag. Again I put my water bottle separate and put some of the smaller things in my pockets, I saw someone do this. I found
                    out because they weight my bag at check-in that they didn't do it again with boarding. I felt like I put all the things in my pockets to save weight for nothing again.</p>
                <h5>Won or lost the Challenge?</h5>
                <p>And with that being my last constricted flight and the fact that I did not have to pay for extra weight. Makes me believe that I won this challenge. I am now more sure that you don't need much when your traveling. I have to say that I
                    found it difficult to keep under the 7kg. Not that I had too many clothes with me because at one point I was wearing almost everything i brought. but I had no idea how much all the other things i brought  weight. I found that I did
                    not think of this. That is why I had no idea that they weight so much.</p>
                <p>The fact that my flight home was not with budget airlines meant I could go and do some shopping! I had a little shopping spree. I forgot to check what my total weight was at check-in. So I can not tell you with how many kgs I left Australia.
                    It could not have been more than 10kg. Ow, a lot of people were very surprised when they found out that I only traveled with hand luggage.</p>
                <p>I would like to challenge all of you readers to take this challenge. You will find how much you really need when you go traveling. It might surprise you how much you really need. Ow if you find out you don't need so much donate, donate
                    and donate your old clothes. Make someone else happy with them.</p>

                <h4>Before I travel</h4>
                <p>I am sitting here in a cafe in Pucon, Chile. Thinking about what I will do today. It is funny always when I tell people that I go traveling far away. They tell me all these places to go. They are not always close to the area where I am
                    going but they know that they are there. Or they come up with very touristic things or expensive things to do there. I also know a lot of people that tell me I have to do research on the whole country, for places I want to go to. It
                    is funny because when I tell people that I am going to Belgium no one really cares. They just say have fun.</p>
                <p>Like it is different if I go to a country far away then close by. I talk a lot to people about traveling and most always tell me I would never dare to do that, traveling alone. I think that when people think about traveling they think
                    about going far away. Mostly only the fact that they would go somewhere, where they don't know the place, people or the language makes them not doing it, defiantly not alone. But do you know what could happen when you go traveling?</p>
                <h4>What is traveling</h4>
                <p>Traveling can be as big or small as you want it to be. You can travel to the other side of the world or you can travel 3 hours from your home. Ow and I know people how would say 3 hours from your house is not traveling, it is only traveling
                    if you go far away. I can tell you it is bullshit, to say it nicely.</p>
                <p>Traveling is all about getting to know new places, doing and learning new things maybe even treating your self to things you would not do that fast at home. Only you can decide where you want to do that. Some people don't like to go far
                    from home so start small. That makes it easier if you really want to go home.</p>
                <h4>Traveling is different for everyone</h4>
                <p>I remember meeting an American family in Seoul. I told them that I would like to go to America because it was this big unknown place we all see in movies. The grandfather in that group told me why to go to American if you can travel throw
                    all those wonderful countries in Europe. In this case, I think we thought the grass was greener on the other side.</p>
                <p>I have learned it is not about taking that perfect picture or what county is the most beautiful. Or how can visit the most tourist places? I do my best to skip most of them. Something about a lot of people in one place, not my thing. Sadly
                    for a lot of people, it is showing off to the people they know about there vacation.</p>
                <h4>Traveling for me</h4>
                <p>Okay, I still think it is sad if people tell me that my travels mean nothing. Just because I skipped an amazing touristic place of thing in a certain country. That still doesn't mean that they got a good look at that same country or even
                    talked to a local person. It doesn't bother me as much anymore. I travel for me and not all the people I met, the people at home or for the perfect picture. I don't like to take selfies alone. I always tell people I don't have to prove
                    that I have been somewhere. People either believe me or they don't.</p>
                <p>People always ask me what was the best country I have visited but I don't think like that. What really sticks with me are the amazing or kind people I have met. Okay, sometimes the food sticks with me too I don't go to another country
                    to eat what I can eat at home and yes not everything I like. Ow, I don't like to brag so when I came home after traveling. My friends and family have to pull it out of me or they will never know.</p>
                <p>It is time for me to go and do something today. I have finished my big pies of cake I have ordered her at the cafe, it took so long to eat.</p>

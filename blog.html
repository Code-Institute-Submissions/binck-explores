                <h3>My experience traveling</h3>
                <p>I am traveling this big beautiful but also mean world and I'm really liking it, most of the time. I'm traveling alone and no I didn't really choose to travel alone, just got sick of waiting until someone finally wanted to come with me. Or all those people who say they want to go with you but never will.<br>Apparently, if you travel alone and you're single I've notes you have a lot of boyfriend's or everyone will expect that you will find that guy while you're traveling, hasn't happened yet.<br>Ow yes, a lot of guys would wane have sex with you and occasionally they wane pay for it, yes it has happened.</p>
                <p>I like that I get to meet so many new people that are kind of all like me, okay just a little bit. I have to say most are very nice and friendly and others rob or ripe you off, yes this also happened. I still hope some of them will stick, I would love to get some friends in different places.<br>It is a big learning curve and a lot of challenges. Like packing my bag every time, getting it to fit every time and not over 20 kilos. I can pack it now fully in 30 minutes. It is also good for exercise walking around with 26 kilo extra gets you into shape, I am much stronger now and most of the time the only one how can carry my bag.<br>Or figuring out how to get to the next hostel and finding one without spending a fortune, yes I am on a budget. I hate it when people just keep saying but what does it matter it is way cheaper here anyway, well the more I can save the farther I can go and no I'm not trying to do it on an amazing tide budget that will never work. Some people can do it or they don't mind sleeping in the park, street, beach or with someone just so that they don't spend too much money. Yah no that is not for me.<br>Ow, my social skills have improved so much, now I can just approach people I have never met and start talking to them! I used to be shy and let me people mostly walk all over me, that's how they say it. Now it doesn't even matter how I am talking to, I mostly forget to ask their names.</p>
                <p>I do sometimes hate it, okay maybe that's a little harsh but yes I get fat up with it. I don't want to say goodbye or hopefully see you later to some all the people. I sometimes wish I wasn't traveling with bags that I have to keep packing and unpacking, it's cheaper also doing it with a small bag. Sometimes I get lonely in between all those dunking people how don't care how much they spend while on holiday. Most times everything is totally not how you want it or it all goes totally wrong and you have to spend way more money then you want, yes that also happened.<br>Ow and the crying. I'm not really the crying type, you can ask my family but I've cried way more on my second trip then I did in my entire life before it.</p>
                <p>I have experienced that traveling has its ups and downs but I think that the way you handed with it will tell you what kind of a traveler you are and in the end what kind of a person you have become because of it.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col col-10">
                <h3>Do you know what could happen?</h3>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <h4>Do you know what could happen?</h4>
<p>Is the one question I got the most when I told people about my plan to travel by myself. Most of them where all the same negative scenario's of what could happen to me. If I am honest I cannot remember if any of them even was positive. Okay my family where lightly enthusiastic about it but they know I could do it. I have been independent for a while by the time I decided to do this at the age of 26. Yes it took me a while and now I have a bachelor I can't do anything with anymore but I would not wane change it in the world.</p>
<h5>I can remember the most negative scenario's people can up with:</h5>
<ul>
<li>You could get rubbed</li>
<li>You could die from a disease, it has happened to people they knew</li>
<li>I can get killed, like you always see on tv</li>
<li>I can get rapped</li>
<li>You could get drugged</li>
<li>I don't speak the language how can you even communicate</li>
<li>I don't know what kind of people are out there</li>
<li>You could get scammed</li>
<li>You could get sick from the food don't eat anything raw or washed with tape water</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting the point by now I think and yes this could all happen to you. I have to say some of it has happend to me. What kind of life would you have, if you had to make sure that this would never happen to you. To tell you the truth it could happen to you. But you wouldn't have to travel that far as some people might think for it to happen.</p>
<h5>So I would say why stay home?</h5>
<p>I live in the Netherlands and it is perceived as a "save country". though in the Netherlands people get rubbed, rapped, drugged or scammed too. I don't know in what country you live in. But are you sure this could not happen in your country? Take America, ow my what a dangerous country is that, with the shootings, drugs and gangs. Even a very "save" country as Sweden. Has places you should not go I have heard. So what if it could happen any where in this big beautiful world, why stay home. I have wrote about. If you want to know more about traveling alone.</p>
<h5>But do they ever tell any of the positive things that could happen to you?</h5>
<p>I have learned so much about myself and overcome so much of my fears and struggles. Some I still have but not as strong anymore. I can tell you for sure that how I felt as a young woman. That I don't feel like that any more about myself. I can remember that after a daytrip in Vietnam. We went out for dinner with most of the people who attended the daytrip. I told them that I was very shy growing up. One of the woman there told me she would have never thought that.</p>
<p>Traveling alone will make you feel better by yourself, will help you to develop your social skills, will help you learn to think different about things and the people that live in other countries. Or at least that is what it has done for me. If you think that I never have a bad day or that I never cry about anything, you're so wrong. I can tell you I have never cried so much as when I went traveling the second time. But after crying and getting over that feeling I could think better about how to fix what I was crying about or think of another way to go about it, so I found it useful.</p>

                <h3>Me beautiful?</h3>
                <h5>Today</h5>
                <p>Me beautiful? To be honest I still would not discribe myself as beautiful. There are times that I don't feel much better about my self then when I started this journey.</p>
                <p>When I don't have plans or I don't have to get out the house. I feel like a boring woman that only eats and watches tv or movies on her laptop. So yes I still have things to work at. I think we all have to keep working on our self te feel better abour our selfs. More because of the fact that we all change. There is a time that we are single, we are a partner, maybe single again, a wife or husband, we become a parent or we decide to become the person we Always felt we where.</p>
                <h5>Beautiful</h5>
                <p>People have been telling me the older I got how beautiful I look. On my trip I have been hearing this even more from different people. From both man and woman. I still can not get used to this. I don't see my self as beautiful. In a hostel in Sydney I was talking with this guy. I told him that a lot of guys would like to have sex with me. He told me that I had to see it as complement, that it means that I look beautiful.</p>
                <p>I think that it might be a complement but I do not base the way how I feel about my self on it. Sorry guys. It sounds like a silly fact. Like how many man would like to have sex with me. To tell the truth I don't know where to base or what "facts" I need to base that on. It is also different for everyone. I think you have to learn how you feel about your self.</p>
                <h5>The old me</h5>
                <p>I started this trip not feeling very good about my self. People told me I was beautiful and still every time I liked a guy he didn't like me. So what does the fact that your are beautiful have to<br />do with anything. If you can't even get the guy you like to go on a date with you. Also I was a little bit to heavy. Even thow I told my self that having a couple of kilo's more is no problem. I know just "losing" weight doesn't fix very thing.</p>
                <p>I had no friends. I thought I had but I found out they where school or work friends. I am also not very good in keeping intouch with everyone. So that does not make it easier to keep friends. it did not change that i felt shit when I was home with myself.</p>
                <h5>Changing</h5>
                <p>I learned so much on this journey and it hasn't even ended. I know now I like to explore, traveling in a way that others wouldn't. Like cycling  32 km, to see a waterfall . While everyone takes the car because there are to many hills. Or I walk for a couple of km to get to my hostel instead of taking a car or public transport. Don't get me wrong I also do that. You can see so much more when you take a different way than when you are just being driven around.</p>
                <p>I actually like going to places I don't know anyone, it feel good. This means that I talk a lot with people, yet I still don't really like calling people on the phone. A lot of my new friends and people that I meet don't believe that I am a shy person. I talk to much now, I think. Or the fact that I keep going to new places alone makes them think I am a very out going person.</p>
                <h5>Feeling better</h5>
                <p>In the beginning I didn't really know why I went on this journey. I just know that I wanted to get away from the situation I was in. I do still remember the place I was when I realized that I LOVED what I was doing. This was the first time in my live I felt this way. It was in Ho Chi Minh and I was wondering the streets. This doesn't mean that I will never go home again, don't worry family. I also lost weight I don't know how much. The important thing is that I feel a lot better about my body now. I'm more afraid now to become like those too skinny women.</p>
                <p>Back to feeling better about my self. All the people I met and experiences that I had. Made me believe in myself. Also I have learned that I can do more then that I every thought. I can tell you that feels good. I can't say that I feel different now that I have lost the weight. I just know that I carry my self different. If you ask my sister I still dress horrible. Even the fact that no guy, so far in real live, has asked me out or taken an interest in me doesn't bother me that much any more. The fact that I feel good about myself. And that I have been starting to love the person that I am now is more important then any guy ever could be. The fact that a lot of people think that I look beautiful, now is more believable.</p>

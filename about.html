                <h3>Hello everyone</h3>

                <h5>About me</h5>
                <p>Here is a little about me. I am Cecilia Binck and I kinda like to do things my way and not too expensive. I have been raised on not spending a lot of money. So I am Always trying to find a way to do things I want for as little money as
                    I can get without becoming extreme, even for me that is a little too far.</p>
                <p>I was never very popular so I did not have a lot of friends and shy so I was used to do things by myself but I would never go on a holiday by myself, I told myself. Yes I was just like you or even worst off. If you would tell my younger
                    self that I would do this growing up I would tell you that your full of it. I was not confident, could not talk to strangers unless at work, very bad at making decisions, was not worth much so why would people want to get to know me
                    and more. So you see I was scared too like you are.</p>

                <h5>My first solo trip</h5>
                <p>I had decided for my first trip I would do volunteer work. After that I would travel another one and a half month. I booked my flight ticket so that I had some time alone before I had to start, to get a feeling of how it would be.</p>
                <p>This is me in India a place you don't wane go as a female solo traveler. I have been told, by what I have heard and read, not a very good place for females in general. But this was the first country I visited on my own and I would do it
                    again if I had the chance. Of course I got scammed like every tourist but the positif side is that in the middle of New Delhi I felt very safe. Having someone by my side that know the city, plus the Indian men left me alone. I had
                    an amazing time in the voluntier house with all the others. I attended an engagment party and a wedding. As my voluntier project I thought English and math to street kids</p>
                <p>From India I went to Nepalto voluntier for about 3 weeks. This time I did all sort of jobs. I also went on a home stay, that is a great way to meet locale people. And visited the national parc Chitwa, Where I saw 4 rhino's. After Nepal
                    I was on my own no more support. Okay I was a bit lost in Seoul and Los Angels because I had no good idea what to do. In New Zealand I trived. Went on a Road trip with two other girls, we hitchiked. Deffently something I had never
                    done before. We meet some great people and we had a good times.</p>

                <h5>Dads advies</h5>
                <p>Now I know what you are wondering how did I. Being scared to take the jump manage to actually do it? None of my small group of friends that I hadwanted to go with me. Finding a travel buddy online is not as easy. There a lot of talk and
                    not much doing so that was no help. A friend of mine went traveling alone and she told me it wasn't as scary as people thought. I was not really convinced. The feeling of going traveling stayed after a while I had it with waiting for
                    someone to go with me. At the rate is was going, I might have found someone at the time I was 80 years old.Or it felt like that. I remember talking about it to my dad. After hearing him say that I could do this. It was going to be
                    a very good experience for me and it would be good for me. My dad used to live in Africa for 3 months when he was younger. It was a time where he learned a lot.</p>
                <p>Okay after this talk I was not totally brave enough but I decide on doing volunteer work in a foreign then I would stay in a volunteer house or a host family, so I would go alone but not be alone. Looking back on it India was a good choose
                    to go to first because I survived India and India is crazy or what I saw of it. So if I could do that I could survive anywhere, crossing Streets turned so easy after Jaipur.</p>

                <h5>What I want</h5>
                <p>I want to help you start traveling, learn about your self and challenge you. Give me your best excusse why you are not already traveling. Yes traveling by your self counts to as traveling and it is a great way to grow as a person.</p>

Binck Explores

I have started a blog a couple of yours ago on Wordpress. I like so many people in this big world was afraid to go and traveling alone. It was this big and scary thing, even though I used to a lot already alone. In the last year of university I thought it was time to just go and travel even though no one else had time because if I had to wait till someone had time I could be eighty. 

So I got a travel around the world ticket with the place I wanted to see and the two counties where I was starting off with doing volunteer work. I have to tell you it was not great all the time but I fell in love with traveling and meeting new people and making friends all over the world.

So a couple of years ago I decided to start showing people that traveling solo isn't that scary and that you can learn a lot about yourself. I have never been very happy about Wordpress, everyone has its own preference, and always wanted to do something else to make it more mine.

This second project is for me so to get back at sharing my experience with traveling with people that are interested in traveling but are not ready to take that first step. I don't just want to inspire them to take the first step just by writing blogs, I want to show then that this is a big world with beautiful place by sharing pictures i have made while I was traveling.

UX

Project Goals

The goals for this project is to give people who want to start traveling to stop waiting till someone else will go with them, or for the perfect moment/time or what other reason they might have and just to start traveling even if that means alone. To get people to not only visit tourist spots in countries but to go explore what makes that county so amazing, most of the time it is not the tourist places. To make people go and do what they have always wanted to do in live but where scared to do or just put it in the category I will do that when the kids are older, on their own or even when we are retired. Even if travel is not part of that dream. It would be great if we could show people that there is enough to discover just around the corner from them because traveling doesn't mean you have to go far.

Design
Framework

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
languages:
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	Jquery
•	JavaScript
•	Propper
•	Markdown

libraries
•	Bootstrap, bootstrap.com
•	https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar, I have used the code from here to make the basis
•	Github, github.com. To help me with creating a better README.md and to help me with documenting my project in a little more detail.
•	https://github.com/Geomint/holiday-destinations

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

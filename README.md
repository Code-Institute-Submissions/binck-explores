# Binck Explores
:house: 

I have started a blog a couple of yours ago on Wordpress. I like so many people in this big world was afraid to go and traveling alone. It was this big and scary thing, even though I used to a lot already alone. In the last year of university I thought it was time to just go and travel even though no one else had time because if I had to wait till someone had time I could be eighty. 

So I got a travel around the world ticket with the place I wanted to see and the two counties where I was starting off with doing volunteer work. I have to tell you it was not great all the time but I fell in love with traveling and meeting new people and making friends all over the world.

So a couple of years ago I decided to start showing people that traveling solo isn't that scary and that you can learn a lot about yourself. I have never been very happy about Wordpress, everyone has its own preference, and always wanted to do something else to make it more mine.

This second project is for me so to get back at sharing my experience with traveling with people that are interested in traveling but are not ready to take that first step. I don't just want to inspire them to take the first step just by writing blogs, I want to show then that this is a big world with beautiful place by sharing pictures i have made while I was traveling.

## UX

### Project Goals

The goals for this project is to give people who want to start traveling to stop waiting till someone else will go with them, or for the perfect moment/time or what other reason they might have and just to start traveling even if that means alone. To get people to not only visit tourist spots in countries but to go explore what makes that county so amazing, most of the time it is not the tourist places. To make people go and do what they have always wanted to do in live but where scared to do or just put it in the category I will do that when the kids are older, on their own or even when we are retired. Even if travel is not part of that dream. It would be great if we could show people that there is enough to discover just around the corner from them because traveling doesn't mean you have to go far.

### How this project can help them

* There are a couple of blog posts that talk about what I think traveling is, how I experienced starting traveling solo and what to do with  those negative scenario's people keep telling you.
* With the Google  map you can get an idea of all the places I have visited in the different countries I have been to and most of them are not tourist places.
* In my portfolio section in this project you can find more amazing pictures from places I have visited.
* There is an blog post about challenging myself to travel for more than 3 weeks with only hand luggage. 

## Framework

I made my wireframe on the website moqups.com, it looked like a good website and easier to use then the last website I tried use. I made an mockup for the 5 differnent pages. I will incert the pages in the project in the folder frameworks.

## Design

The design I come up with for my project is different to most of the webepages that we see on a daily basis and involves a lot of pictures. I thought the design looked good but after working on it for a while I found out that it is not going to work as well as I hoped, so I had to make some changes.

color navbar:

navbar text: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/color_tryit.asp?hex=FF8C00

### Navbar

I wanted my webe page to stand out so the navbar in vertical instead of horizontal. I made the disicion to make it a very bold and in your face because i wanted to be a design statement of my project. I started with a black background color but I think that is a bit to hard for what I want.

The colors of the text on the navbar i want them to pop out the dark background. I was thinking about making the logo and what colors and I want to put a bit of my background in it, I still have to make it. But it made me decide to give the text the color orange. It pops out of the dark background and it has a special meaning to me.



In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
## languages

* HTML
* CSS
* Jquery
* JavaScript
* Propper
* Markdown

## libraries

* Bootstrap, bootstrap.com
    * https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar, I have used the code from here to make the basis
* Github, github.com. To help me with creating a better README.md and to help me with documenting my project in a little more detail.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

###Contact form:
* Went to the Contact page.
* Tried to send the form without filling in any of the fields to see if an error would appear, it did.
* Tried to sent the form without filling in a correct email address to see if an error would appear, it did.
* Tried to sent the form with all the field filled in to see if a success message would appear, it did.
* Tried to sent the form with all the fields filled in without internet to see if a failed message would appear, it did.

--In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.--


##Bugs in development

###Bug 1.
When submitting contact form it gave an error.

###Solution:
I had used the wrong value names in my function so when I gave  the values the same names as the parameters I was able to send and receive an email. 

###Bug 2.
After setting up my Google maps API it was not showing a map.

###Solution:
Tutor Scott Kipp saw that my function was targeting an ID but in my HTML file I put in a class. So I only had to changed the class in to ID in my HTML file .

###Bug 3.
My background image would not cover the entire page or would through off the navbar.

###Solution:
Tutor Tim Nelson has looked at it and found that with less css and when put in the body element it works. It will still be under the navbar but it covers the entire page.

###Bug 4.
Container keeps sliding under the navbar.

###solution:
I gave the container a margin-left of 220px to push it from going under the navbar.

##Remaining bugs

I replaced the markers in my function for Google maps. Now no markers show up in the Google maps map.



Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
